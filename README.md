# LSTRebalancer: Automated LP Position Adjustment for LST Pools

## Introduction

LSTRebalancer is a decentralized service built on EigenLayer that automatically adjusts Liquidity Provider (LP) positions for Liquid Staking Token (LST) pools in Uniswap V4. By leveraging EigenLayer's Actively Validated Services (AVS), LSTRebalancer optimizes LP positions to account for the yield-bearing nature of LSTs, reducing slippage and improving overall pool efficiency.

## Problem Statement

In Uniswap pools involving Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) like stETH-ETH or rETH-USDC:

1. LPs face extra slippage due to the natural yield-bearing characteristics of LSTs.
2. The yield accrual causes the price ratio in the pool to drift over time, leading to suboptimal liquidity distribution.
3. Manual rebalancing is inefficient, costly, and often overlooked by LPs.

## Our Solution

LSTRebalancer addresses these challenges by:

1. Automatically reading the yield from liquid staking positions.
2. Adjusting all LP positions up the curve by a constant amount to account for accrued yield.
3. Leveraging EigenLayer's AVS for secure, decentralized execution of rebalancing operations.

## How LSTRebalancer Works

1. AVS operators continuously monitor LST yields for supported pools.
2. When yield accrual reaches a predetermined threshold, the rebalancing process is triggered.
3. The system calculates the optimal position adjustment based on accrued yield.
4. EigenLayer AVS validates and executes the rebalancing transaction.
5. LP positions are automatically adjusted, maintaining optimal liquidity distribution.

    participant UP as Uniswap V4 Pool
    participant YM as Yield Monitoring Module
    participant CE as Calculation Engine
    participant AVS as EigenLayer AVS
    participant PA as Position Adjustment Module

    loop Continuous Monitoring
        UP->>YM: Provide yield & pool data
        YM->>CE: Update yield information
        CE->>CE: Check rebalancing threshold
        alt Threshold Reached
            CE->>AVS: Send rebalancing request
            AVS->>AVS: Validate request
            AVS->>PA: Execute position adjustment
            PA->>UP: Adjust LP positions
            UP-->>PA: Confirm adjustment
            PA-->>AVS: Report success
            AVS-->>CE: Confirm execution
        end
    end
```

## Key Benefits

1. Reduced Slippage: Maintains optimal liquidity distribution despite LST yield accrual.
2. Improved Capital Efficiency: Ensures LP capital is always optimally positioned.
3. Automated Management: Reduces the need for manual intervention by LPs.
4. Gas Efficiency: Batched rebalancing operations minimize gas costs.
5. Decentralized Security: Leverages EigenLayer's robust security model.

## Use Cases

1. stETH-ETH pools
2. rETH-USDC pools
3. Other LST-based liquidity pools

## Future Roadmap

1. Support for additional LST tokens and pools
2. Advanced yield prediction algorithms
3. Integration with other DEXs beyond Uniswap
4. User interface for LP position monitoring and manual triggers
5. Cross-chain LST pool rebalancing
